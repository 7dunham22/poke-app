# My Poke App

## My experiment with the PokeAPI.

This app enables users to search through the complete list of pokemon and retrieve the pokemon's image and list of abilities.

The app retrieves data from the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/ 'PokeAPI') and presents the data in a visually appealing way using React-Bootstrap.

When users type the name of a pokemon into the search bar, a dropdown list appears with the names of potential matches. This feature is achieved with the support of [React Bootstrap Typeahead](https://ericgio.github.io/react-bootstrap-typeahead/#filtering).

Please view the deployed app [here](https://poke-app-9d872.web.app/).
